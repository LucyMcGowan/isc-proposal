## Detail

### Software Development

We plan to develop software with a distinct pedagogical focus, designed expressly to facilitate effective learning experiences. This software will be crafted to guide learners through the intricacies of causal inference within the R environment. By leveraging user-friendly interfaces, our software aims to empower users with a comprehensive understanding of causal inference methodologies. We have begun development of several of these tools: `ggdag`: a package to facilitate creating causal diagrams, `halfmoon`: a package to assist with checking and visualizing balance between exposure groups, and `propensity`: a package for fitting propensity score models.

### Curriculum Development

The content will be based on our forthcoming book, "Causal Inference in R". We will create slide decks, lab exercises, and assessments, all hosted on GitHub. The content will include references to relevant book sections, allowing learners to easily navigate between the course and the book for a deeper understanding. We plan to create the content in plain language, avoiding jargon or technical terms that may be unfamiliar to learners.

**Slide Decks:** We will create visually engaging slide decks for each chapter. These will incorporate clear explanations, illustrative examples, and relevant visuals to facilitate understanding. 

**Lab Exercises:** We will develop a series of hands-on lab exercises corresponding to the concepts covered in each chapter. Provide datasets, code templates, and specific tasks to guide learners through the application of causal inference techniques in R.

**Assessments:** We will integrate quizzes, self-assessment questions, and knowledge checks within the course materials to reinforce learning and allow educator and learners to gauge progress.

### Accessibility and Inclusivity

We plan to provide alternative formats for learners with different learning preferences, such as audio versions or transcripts for the visually impaired.

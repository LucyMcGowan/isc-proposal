# Signatories

The following members of the community have endorsed our proposal:

**Max Kuhn**, Posit, lead developer of tidymodels: "This critical topic is complicated and has no public and easy-to-use public educational tools. Having these particular experts develop training materials using open and cost free software would enable many practitioners to 'level up' their expertise."

**Eleanor Murray**, Boston University, Assistant Professor of Epidemiology: "This will be a useful contribution for educators and learners in the R and epidemiology communities. These experts have a track record for creating useful content and are uniquely suited to make this contribution and I look forward to the end product."

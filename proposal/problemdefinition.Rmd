# The Problem

In the rapidly evolving landscape of data science and statistical analysis, there is an increasing demand for advanced techniques in causal inference. Despite the availability of powerful tools like R for statistical computing, there exists a noticeable gap in accessible and comprehensive educational resources tailored specifically for causal inference within the R community.

This gap poses a significant challenge for R users seeking to harness the full potential of their data, as they often lack structured guidance in applying causal inference methodologies effectively. As a result, many researchers, analysts, and practitioners encounter difficulties in accurately deriving causal relationships from observational data, leading to sub-optimal decision-making and potentially skewed outcomes in various domains.

Currently, there exist workshops that aim to teach individual practitioners causal inference techniques, including one created by the authors on this proposal. These individual workshops do not scale with the outsize demand for educational materials in causal inference, necessitating a new strategy for disseminating this material. One successful example in this space is Miguel Hern√°n's [MOOC on Causal Inference](https://www.edx.org/learn/data-analysis/harvard-university-causal-diagrams-draw-your-assumptions-before-your-conclusions), which has enrolled over 78,000 students through September 2023, demonstrating the high level of interest in causal techniques. Unfortunately, this course does not focus on implementation in R. 

To fill this gap, we are proposing a "teach the teacher" model that also allows individual learners to make use of the material on their own: Causal Inference in a Box. Causal Inference in a Box is based on the Posit Data Science in a Box template, where we create a set of material that is ready to teach.

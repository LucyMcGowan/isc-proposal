# The Problem

In the rapidly evolving landscape of data science and statistical analysis, the demand for advanced techniques in causal inference has become increasingly critical. Despite the availability of powerful tools like R for statistical computing, there exists a noticeable gap in accessible and comprehensive educational resources tailored specifically for causal inference within the R community.

This gap poses a significant challenge for R users seeking to harness the full potential of their data, as they often lack structured guidance in applying causal inference methodologies effectively. As a result, many researchers, analysts, and practitioners encounter difficulties in accurately deriving causal relationships from observational data, leading to sub-optimal decision-making and potentially skewed outcomes in various domains.

Currently, there exist workshops that aim to teach individual practitioners causal inference techniques, including one created by several authors on this proposal. These individual workshops do not scale as rapidly as the demand for educational materials for these techniques, necessitating a new strategy for disseminating this material. For example, Miguel Hernan's MOOC on Causal Inference has had over 78,000 students enrolled, suggesting the high level of interest in learning these techniques, but unfortunately this course does not focus on implementation in R. To fill this gap, we are proposing a "teach the teacher" model that also allows individual learners to make use of the material on their own, based on the Posit "Data Science in a Box" template, where we create a set of material: "Causal Inference in a Box".

Addressing this knowledge deficit is imperative to empower the R community with the skills necessary to conduct robust causal analyses and draw meaningful conclusions from their datasets. By providing a dedicated "Causal Inference in a Box" course, we aim to bridge this educational gap and equip R users with the requisite expertise to conduct rigorous causal assessments, thereby significantly enhancing the quality and reliability of their research and analyses.

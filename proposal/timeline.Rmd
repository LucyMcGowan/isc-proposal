# Project plan

## Start-up phase
<!--
Covering the planning phase, this section should provide a relatively detailed plan of how work will start on the project. This section is important because projects need to get up and running quickly.


 - [ ] Setting up collaboration platform inc. code for contributors etc.
 - [ ] Licence decisions
 - [ ] Reporting framework
-->


## Technical delivery
<!--
Covering the actual delivery of the project this section should provide at least a high-level the implementation. 

Including target dates is really important as you need to be committed and the ISC need to have a means of tracking delivery
-->

## Other aspects
<!--
Covering non-technical activities like on-going publicity, paper preparation, discussion groups etc. that might be required to facilitate successful delivery of the project.

From Malcolm: I'm adjusting this checklist to include some potential routes

 - [ ] Chapterly updates on our blog + releases of software
 - [ ] ~~Twitter~~ social media of all sorts EXCEPT twitter
 - [ ] UseR!
 - [ ] posit::conf()
 - [ ] ISC meetings
